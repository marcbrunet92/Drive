MODULE 1: PACKAGES AND IMPORTS
General tools
• dir(module_name) → Lists all available attributes: module.xxx.
• pow(x, 2) → Computes ( x^2 ).
• hypot(x, y) → Returns the length of the hypotenuse when the legs are x and y.
Random module
• random.seed(x: int | None)
o If x is None, the seed uses the current system time (seconds).
o If x is an integer, the generator becomes deterministic (same seed → same sequence, except for minor floating-point variations).
• random.choice(sequence) → Returns a single random element from a non-empty sequence.
• random.sample(sequence, n) → Returns a list of n distinct items from the sequence (n ≤ len(sequence)).
Platform module
• platform.platform(aliased=False, terse=False)
o terse=True → shorter, less detailed output. Returns a detailed OS name string.
• platform.machine() → Returns a generic CPU architecture name.
• platform.processor() → Returns a precise processor name.
• platform.system() → Returns the generic OS name.
• platform.version() → OS version string.
• platform.python_implementation() → Returns the Python implementation (usually CPython).
• platform.python_version_tuple() → Returns the Python version as (major, minor, patch).
Modules and execution
• __name__ = '__main__' when the file is executed as a script.
• __name__ = module_name when imported as a module.
sys module
• sys.path → List of filesystem paths where Python looks for packages.
o Use .append() to add directories.
o Use double backslashes \\ on Windows.
pip
• pip install --user package_name → installs a package for the current user only.
• pip install -U package_name → upgrades an installed package.
• “The Cheese Shop” → humorous reference to PyPI.
Definitions
• A namespace is a space in which a name exists.
• pip --version, pip version, and pip -version all display the pip version.
STRINGS
General concepts
• Internationalization is shortened to I18N.
• Classic ASCII uses 8 bits per character.
• A code point is the numeric value representing a Unicode character.
• UCS-4 uses 32 bits per character and stores raw Unicode code points.
• UTF-8 encoding (simplified explanation):
o ASCII characters → 8 bits
o Many non-Latin characters → 16 bits
o Ideograms (e.g., Chinese) → 24 bits
• A BOM (Byte Order Mark) indicates the encoding used (UTF-8, UCS-4, etc.).
Properties
• Python strings are immutable sequences: "str" object does not support item assignment.
• In multiline strings, the \n newline character counts toward len().
• chr(code_point) → converts a code point into its character.
• ord(character) → converts a character into its code point.
Slicing sequence[start : stop : step] → stop is excluded. To reverse a string: text[::-1].
STRING METHODS
1. Modification, analysis, and transformation
• capitalize() → first character uppercase, others lowercase. Returns a new string.
• center(width, fillchar) → returns a string of length width padded with fillchar. If width is too small, returns the original string.
• count(substring) → counts occurrences.
• join(iterable) → joins elements using the string as a separator. Example: ",".join(["omicron","pi","rho"]) → "omicron,pi,rho".
• lower() → lowercase version.
• lstrip(chars) → strips characters from the start. "www.cisco.com".lstrip("w.") → "cisco.com".
• replace(a, b, max) → replace substring a with b up to max times.
• rfind(substring) → like find but searches from the end.
• rstrip(chars) → strips characters from the end.
• split() → splits on whitespace, ignoring leading/trailing whitespace.
• strip() → strips whitespace from both ends.
• swapcase() → lowercase → uppercase and uppercase → lowercase.
• title() → first letter of each word uppercase, rest lowercase.
• upper() → uppercase version.
• find(substring, start) → returns index or -1 if not found.
• "a".index("a") → returns first index; raises ValueError if not found.
2. Boolean string tests
All return True or False:
• endswith(substring)
• isalnum() → letters + digits only
• isalpha() → letters only
• isdigit() → digits only
• islower()
• isspace()
• isupper()
• startswith(substring)
STRING COMPARISON RULES
• 'alpha' < 'alphabet' (shorter prefix is smaller)
• 'beta' > 'Beta' → lowercase characters are greater than uppercase.
• 'alpha' == 'alpha'
• 'alpha' != 'Alpha'
• '10' != '010' because '1' > '0' in first character comparison.
• string == number → always False.
• Uppercase < lowercase in ASCII/Unicode ordering.
EXCEPTIONS
General information
• Python 3 defines 63 built-in exceptions.
• They form an inheritance tree. For example: ZeroDivisionError is a subclass of ArithmeticError.
• Order of exception handlers matters: always catch more specific exceptions before more general ones.
• except (exc1, exc2): is allowed.
• raise without specifying an exception is allowed, but only inside an except block.
• assert x triggers AssertionError if x is evaluated as False, 0, '', or None.
IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS
ArithmeticError Location: BaseException ← Exception ← ArithmeticError Description: Abstract exception for arithmetic-related errors (e.g., invalid numeric domain).
AssertionError Location: BaseException ← Exception ← AssertionError Description: Raised by assert when the tested expression is False, None, 0, or empty.
BaseException Location: BaseException Description: Root of all Python exceptions. except: is equivalent to except BaseException:.
IndexError Location: BaseException ← Exception ← LookupError ← IndexError Description: Accessing an out-of-range index in a sequence.
KeyboardInterrupt Location: BaseException ← KeyboardInterrupt Description: Raised when a user presses interrupt keys (e.g., Ctrl+C).
LookupError Location: BaseException ← Exception ← LookupError Description: Abstract parent class for errors caused by invalid lookups (indexes, keys, etc.).
MemoryError Location: BaseException ← Exception ← MemoryError Description: Raised when no memory is available for an operation.
OverflowError Location: BaseException ← Exception ← ArithmeticError ← OverflowError Description: Raised when a number is too large to store.
ImportError Location: BaseException ← Exception ← StandardError ← ImportError Description: Raised when an import operation fails.
KeyError Location: BaseException ← Exception ← LookupError ← KeyError Description: Raised when trying to access a dictionary key that does not exist.
